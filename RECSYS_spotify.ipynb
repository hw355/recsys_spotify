       "      <td>On this week's show...  During a MeUndies ad read, Jason realizes that David has stolen all the free underwear that was sent their way. This leads to a larger discussion about Jason's underwear habits, and how he he has no time to do laundry.  Then, Jason talks about being bipolar, introduces the world to his team of bodyguards, tells the story of David's terrifying firework prank, and gives David's mom a call, before being accused of having a thing for Liza.  Also, the guys mentioned it during the show, but don't forget--Views LIVE is coming up on August 13th at the Irvine Improv! Hope to see you there.  Welcome to VIEWS.

       "4     When the pandemic was bearing down on New York last March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration issued a directive that allowed Covid-19 patients to be discharged into nursing homes in a bid to free up hospital beds for the sickest patients.

       "3358  On this week's show...  During a MeUndies ad read, Jason realizes that David has stolen all the free underwear that was sent their way. This leads to a larger discussion about Jason's underwear habits, and how he he has no time to do laundry.  Then, Jason talks about being bipolar, introduces the world to his team of bodyguards, tells the story of David's terrifying firework prank, and gives David's mom a call, before being accused of having a thing for Liza.

       "3358  On this week's show...  During a MeUndies ad read, Jason realizes that David has stolen all the free underwear that was sent their way. This leads to a larger discussion about Jason's underwear habits, and how he he has no time to do laundry.  Then, Jason talks about being bipolar, introduces the world to his team of bodyguards, tells the story of David's terrifying firework prank, and gives David's mom a call, before being accused of having a thing for Liza.  Also, the guys mentioned it during the show, but don't forget--Views LIVE is coming up on August 13th at the Irvine Improv! Hope to see you there.  Welcome to VIEWS.
